gemini is some protocol that lies between gopher and http.
and also a file format that's somewhere between text/plain and markdown

https://gemini.circumlunar.space/ read more about it here.

Requires uritools for uricut and html_entities_decode.

git://thebackupbox.net/html_entities_decode

But html_entities_decode isn't important.

uristart is used by the "gemini" script to launch a file:// URI of the cached file.
uristart expects a file in ~/.config/uristart.conf
The included lines for gemini schemed URIs and file schemed URIs will need a mimetype.conf
file in ~/.config

You can grep for it and replace it with whatever you think looks good.

Also uses dmenu and ncat --ssl.

You should be able to grep for and replace those with whatever you like to use.

If you swap ncat --ssl for openssl s_client, be sure to use -quiet or -ign_eof (which -quiet implies)
