same uritools dep as old version.

this time I split apart the handling of the requesting
and the handling of the response.

gemini-get will just send the network request to the right place
and output the whole thing (header included) to stdout.

gemini-message-handler reads a "message/gemini" from stdin
and then attempts to launch a stream-handler if it can for the mime-type
if it fails, it caches the response into a file and uses uristart
to launch a program to handle the file:///?mime-type= URI

----- old stuff below. some of it still useful. -----

gemini is some protocol that lies between gopher and http.
and also a file format that's somewhere between text/plain and markdown

https://gemini.circumlunar.space/ read more about it here.

Requires uritools for uricut and html_entities_decode.

git://thebackupbox.net/uritools
git://thebackupbox.net/html_entities_decode

But html_entities_decode isn't important.

uristart is used by the "gemini" script to launch a file:// URI of the cached file.
uristart expects a file in ~/.config/uristart.conf
The included lines for gemini schemed URIs and file schemed URIs will need a mimetype.conf
file in ~/.config

You can grep for it and replace it with whatever you think looks good.

Also uses dmenu and ncat --ssl.

You should be able to grep for and replace those with whatever you like to use.

If you swap ncat --ssl for openssl s_client, be sure to use -quiet or -ign_eof (which -quiet implies)
